    <h1 style="color: red;">Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites, involving a variety of tasks and technologies. Front-end development focuses on the design and interactivity that users see and interact with in their browsers. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which combine to create a seamless and responsive user experience. On the other hand, back-end development deals with the server-side operations, ensuring that everything on the website works correctly, from databases to server communication. Technologies like Node.js, Python, and PHP are commonly used to build the infrastructure that supports a website's functionality.</h1>
    
    <p class="internal-style">In recent years, web development has evolved significantly with the rise of frameworks and libraries. Tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js have simplified front-end development by providing reusable components and efficient rendering. These libraries allow developers to build more dynamic and interactive web applications, improving the overall performance and user engagement. Likewise, the back-end has benefited from frameworks such as Django, Express, and Ruby on Rails, which streamline server-side programming and enable rapid development. </p>
    
    <p class="external-style">Responsive web design has become an essential practice, as the variety of devices and screen sizes continues to grow. With mobile traffic surpassing desktop usage, developers must ensure that websites are optimized for smartphones, tablets, and other devices. This requires a mobile-first approach, where designs are built with smaller screens in mind and then scaled up for larger displays. Using flexible grid layouts and media queries, web developers can create websites that offer a consistent and user-friendly experience across all platforms.</p>
